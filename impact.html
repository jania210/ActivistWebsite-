  <h1>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF TOURISM </h1>
<h3>
<!-- Sub Title -->
The tourism industry is exponentially expanding and it brings with it plenty of negative environmental impacts.

<!-- Negative Impacts with pargraph -->

<h2> AIR POLLUTION AND NOISE</h2>

<p>Emissions from transportation and  from the production and use of energy are associated with acid rain, global warming and photochemical pollution. Air pollution from tourism transport has a global impact, especially through carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with transport energy consumption. And it can contribute to  air pollution in serious areas. Some of these effects are very specific to tourism activities. For example, coaches often leave the engine running for hours while tourists are on an excursion, especially in very hot or cold countries,  because they want to return to a comfortable air-conditioned coach.</p>

<h2>SOLID WASTE AND LITTERING </h2>

<p>In mountain areas, trekking tourists also contribute to littering. Tourists on expedition leave behind their garbage, oxygen cylinders and even camping equipment. Such practices degrade the environment with all the detritus typical of the developed world, in remote areas that have few garbage collection or disposal facilities. Some trails in the Peruvian Andes and in Nepal frequently visited by tourists have been nicknamed "Coca-Cola trail" and "Toilet paper trail".</p>

<h2>Displacement of Locals</h2>
<p>Tourism continues to grow as the years go by. It is a beautiful thing to want to explore the world and one's culture. Although, we have to sit back and look at how we are negatively affecting the places we visit and reform these issues. One of these several issues that tourism contributes to is displacement. Areas that are heavily visited by tourists disrupt thriving local communities. In order to accommodate the many tourists visiting they have to make several hotels and provide basic necessities  or more in order to satisfy tourists. This leads to the basic cost of living to escalate and competition over scarce natural resources. The increase of cost of living drives locals out as they aren't able to pay the high cost. Additionally, natural resources become scarce for locals because it's being used to accommodate the tourists first which also drives locals out.</p>
