<center><h3>Hello, My name is Jania. My nickname is Star! I'm a senior in high school. I plan on majoring in Computer Science and Business Adminstration. My hobbies are reading, watching kdramas, dancing, and listening to music. I would say that music is my top hobbie. I love making playlist and exploring new artists in my free time. As person who also loves traveling and plans to travel in the future. I want to bring awareness to the negative impacts of tourism. So we as tourists can become aware of our impact.</h3></center>
